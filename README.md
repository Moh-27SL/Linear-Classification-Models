# Linear-Classification-Models
This repository contains implementations of linear classification models developed from scratch using PyTorch, as part of Assignment 2.  The assignment focuses on understanding discriminative linear classifiers, loss functions, optimization using gradient descent, and performance evaluation for both binary and multiclass problems.
